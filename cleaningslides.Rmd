## Cleaning up data

One of the essential tasks of data science.  
Most data come to you in less than ideal format. 

We'll use palmerpenguins package .

##

Please open up the cleaning.Rmd file from your project.   
Follow along in the file.  
Look at the two data sets in the package.  
What differences do you see?   

Put notes here:

Keep updating those as we go.

## Looking with code

Just staring won't get us far.  

Four base functions we can use to descibe a file:

`nrow()`, `length()`, `names()`, `str()`. 

Try those and keep updating the sheet as we go on.

##  Interlude

We're exploring and noting the differences.
We can also start creating a list of things that need 
to be done.

## Tools for cleaning

We can use many functions from base R and from 
various packages to clean the data.

We'll use dplyr functions (from the tidyverse)


- `filter()`: keep rows that satisfy your conditions
- `select()`: keep or exclude some columns
- `rename()`: rename columns
- `relocate()`: move columns around
- `mutate()`: add a new column
- `group_by()` + `summarize()`: get summary statistics by group
- `across()`: apply a function across columns
- `count()`: quickly find counts for different groups
- `case_when()`: like friendly if-else

## Let's go

Now let's work on actually modifying things.
